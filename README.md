# Visualizing the basic concepts of Image processing

## Background

The project was created as part of 18ECE40T (Machine Perception and Cognition) at SRM Institute of Science and Technology under the Guidance of Dr. M. Susila with the aim to create interactive visualizations related to the coursework.

The executable applications created by PyInstaller are available on the undermentioned google drive link.

The modules can be used both as standalone executables accesible by the google drive link or by cloning the repo.

The modules are written in python and have used pysimplegui to create the GUI along with webbrowser to allow users to access the relevant theory to the modules on the net however a net connection is not required to use the modules
Some modules (such as image Erosion and Dilation) require users to input images while other make use of openCV to capture the video stream from the users webcam. 

## State of the Project

Concepts that have be implemented:

  * Erosion and Dilation of Image
  * Background separation in image
  * Medial Axis Theorem 
  * Skeletal Point Cloud using mediapipe
  * Face point cloud using mediapipe
  * Visualizing difference between two images using heat map
  * Basic Implementation of Gabor Filter
  * Basic Transformations on Image Orientation
  * Visualizing color spaces
  * Edge Vs contour
  * Canny Edge detector and basic filters
  * Artistic Filters 

Currently work on the project is halted.

## Librarires used
  * OpenCV
  * PySimpleGUI
  * Pillow
  * numpy
  * webbrowser
  * Colour
  * mediapipe
  * math
  * Sci-Kit Image
  * PyInstaller
